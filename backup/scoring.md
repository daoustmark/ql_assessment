With Scott, I'd acknowledge his frustration while reminding him of the reality that we don't have a signed APA. With Jonathan, I'd establish that while we're open to discussion, the last-minute timing creates significant problems given employee disclosure. I'd suggest a middle-ground counteroffer that preserves the core deal structure while allowing for specific adjustments to address the Amazon TOS concern with verification." |

### De-escalation & Emotional Management (20 points)

|Score|Behavioral Anchors|Example Response Elements|
|---|---|---|
|**17-20**|• Uses at least 3 specific validation statements for emotional concerns<br>• Redirects emotions toward productive problem-solving<br>• Maintains neutral positioning between parties<br>• Demonstrates clear emotional boundary-setting<br>• Creates psychological safety while establishing limits|"Scott, I completely understand your frustration - this timing feels manipulative and puts you in a difficult position with your team. That said, I need you to take a deep breath before we respond. Rather than reacting from anger, let's analyze what's actually happening here. The TOS update is potentially verifiable, which means there might be legitimate concerns mixed with negotiation tactics."|
|**13-16**|• Uses 1-2 validation statements<br>• Maintains professional tone throughout<br>• Shows awareness of emotional dynamics<br>• Avoids escalating language<br>• Balances empathy with practical focus|"I understand this is incredibly frustrating, especially with the timing. Let's focus on what we know: the Amazon change is potentially real, but the demand and timing feel like negotiation tactics. Before responding emotionally, let's verify the TOS change and develop a measured response."|
|**9-12**|• Acknowledges emotions basically<br>• Attempts to reduce tension<br>• May occasionally use language that validates unproductive positions<br>• Shows basic empathy but limited guidance<br>• Addresses emotions superficially|"I know you're angry, Scott, and you have a right to be with this last-minute demand. Let's try to salvage this deal though - maybe we can meet somewhere in the middle with their requests."|
|**1-8**|• Uses language that escalates emotions<br>• Takes sides inappropriately<br>• Dismisses legitimate emotional responses<br>• Uses patronizing or dismissive language<br>• Shows poor emotional regulation in own response|"You need to get your emotions under control, Scott. This is just business. The buyer has all the leverage now because you've already told your employees about the sale. You should accept the new terms rather than getting upset."|

### Negotiation Tactics & Leverage Identification (20 points)

|Score|Behavioral Anchors|Example Response Elements|
|---|---|---|
|**17-20**|• Identifies at least 3 non-obvious leverage points<br>• Creates specific counterproposals with rationales<br>• Establishes clear boundaries while maintaining engagement<br>• Proposes creative alternatives beyond price<br>• Articulates specific verification steps for claims|"Three key leverage points we can use: 1) The verifiability of the Amazon TOS change - we should request documentation and calculate the actual impact on only the affected product line; 2) The buyer's admission they're still interested in acquiring the business, indicating they value the asset; and 3) The time investment they've already made. I'd propose addressing the specific Amazon concern with a targeted adjustment to the inventory guarantee for the Dutch ovens only, rather than a blanket price reduction."|
|**13-16**|• Identifies 1-2 leverage points<br>• Creates a reasonable counter strategy<br>• Establishes some boundaries<br>• Suggests alternative approaches<br>• Shows awareness of verification needs|"We have leverage in that the buyer is clearly still interested in the business. I'd request documentation of the Amazon TOS change and suggest that instead of a 15% reduction, we consider a 5% price adjustment with more specific inventory guarantees for the affected product line only."|
|**9-12**|• Identifies basic negotiation positions<br>• Proposes general compromise solutions<br>• Shows limited creativity in alternatives<br>• Recognizes some pressure points<br>• Presents incomplete verification strategy|"I'd suggest splitting the difference on the price reduction, maybe agreeing to 7-8% instead of 15%, and extending the inventory guarantee to 45 days as a compromise. We should ask for proof of the Amazon TOS change."|
|**1-8**|• Misidentifies or overlooks key leverage points<br>• Proposes capitulation or extreme hardline stance<br>• Shows no attempts at creative solutions<br>• Fails to verify claims<br>• Demonstrates poor understanding of power dynamics|"We should just tell them to take the deal as originally agreed or we'll walk away. If they really want the business, they won't risk losing it over this. They're just trying to squeeze us at the last minute."|

### Communication Effectiveness (15 points)

|Score|Behavioral Anchors|Example Response Elements|
|---|---|---|
|**13-15**|• Uses distinct communication approaches tailored to each party<br>• Employs at least 3 strategic framing techniques<br>• Demonstrates active listening with specific reference to concerns<br>• Uses precise, unambiguous language<br>• Organizes communication with clear priorities|"With Scott, I'll acknowledge his frustration but redirect: 'I understand why you're angry - this feels manipulative given the timing. However, before we respond, let's verify whether this Amazon TOS change is legitimate.' With Jonathan, I'll maintain professional objectivity: 'I appreciate your continued interest in the business. To properly evaluate your request, we'll need documentation of the TOS change and specific calculations showing the impact on the Dutch oven product line only.'"|
|**10-12**|• Uses appropriate tone for each audience<br>• Employs 1-2 strategic framing techniques<br>• References key concerns<br>• Uses generally clear language<br>• Presents information in logical order|"I'll speak with Scott first to calm his emotions while acknowledging his concerns. Then I'll respond to Jonathan professionally, requesting specific documentation about the Amazon TOS change while emphasizing that this last-minute request creates significant challenges for the deal timeline."|
|**7-9**|• Shows some audience awareness<br>• Basic message organization<br>• Some ambiguous language<br>• Adequate but unrefined communication<br>• Includes unnecessary details|"I'll tell Scott to stay calm and that we'll work through this. I'll tell Jonathan that we need more information about the Amazon changes and that the timing of his request is problematic. We might be able to work something out, but we'll need time to evaluate everything."|
|**1-6**|• Uses inappropriate tone<br>• Disorganized messaging<br>• Contains significant ambiguities<br>• Lacks clear priorities<br>• Includes inflammatory language|"I'll just forward Jonathan's email to Scott and let them work it out directly. If I get involved, I'll probably just tell Jonathan this is a ridiculous last-minute tactic and tell Scott he needs to calm down."|

### Problem-Solving & Creative Solutions (15 points)

|Score|Behavioral Anchors|Example Response Elements|
|---|---|---|
|**13-15**|• Proposes at least 2 innovative alternatives beyond price adjustment<br>• Addresses underlying interests rather than positions<br>• Creates value-adding options for both parties<br>• Segments the problem into solvable components<br>• Demonstrates understanding of risk allocation principles|"Rather than a blanket price reduction, I'd propose: 1) Maintaining the original purchase price but creating a 90-day escrow of 7% specifically tied to the performance of the Dutch oven product line post-Amazon TOS change; 2) Collaborating on a transition plan specifically for this product line that might include repackaging to avoid the oversized classification; and 3) A shared upside arrangement if mitigation strategies successfully maintain margins on this product line."|
|**10-12**|• Proposes at least 1 alternative beyond price<br>• Identifies core concerns behind positions<br>• Creates some mutual benefit<br>• Breaks down the problem<br>• Shows basic risk management|"Instead of reducing the overall price, we could create a specific escrow amount tied to the performance of the Dutch oven line for 60 days post-closing. This would protect the buyer from the specific risk they're concerned about while allowing the seller to maintain the headline purchase price if the impact is less severe than anticipated."|
|**7-9**|• Suggests standard compromise approaches<br>• Focuses mostly on positions<br>• Creates basic trade-offs<br>• Treats the problem as one-dimensional<br>• Shows limited risk consideration|"We could suggest a smaller price reduction of 7-8% instead of 15%, and maybe meet in the middle on the inventory guarantee with 60 days instead of 90. This gives both sides some of what they want."|
|**1-6**|• Limited to basic acceptance/rejection<br>• Fails to look beyond stated positions<br>• Creates win-lose scenarios<br>• Treats problem as all-or-nothing<br>• Shows poor risk understanding|"The seller should either accept the new terms or walk away. There's no middle ground here - either the TOS change is a problem or it isn't."|

## Part 6: Behavioral & Honesty Check

### Scoring Framework

This section uses a different approach than pure numerical scoring:

#### Internal Consistency Analysis

- Compare responses to related items within this section
- Flag significant inconsistencies in self-reporting

#### Cross-Section Consistency

- Compare behavioral self-reports to actual demonstrated behaviors in earlier sections
- Flag significant discrepancies between claimed and demonstrated approaches

#### Response Pattern Analysis

- Evaluate for signs of social desirability bias (unrealistically positive self-portrayal)
- Look for candid acknowledgment of human limitations vs. perfectionist self-image

#### Red Flag Identification

- Mark specific concerning response patterns (e.g., consistently prioritizing commission over client welfare)
- Note areas where self-perception differs significantly from demonstrated ability

### Interpretation Guidelines

Rather than a pure score, this section produces a qualitative assessment:

- **High Integrity/Accurate Self-Assessment**: Responses show consistency with demonstrated behaviors; acknowledges normal human limitations
- **Generally Consistent**: Minor discrepancies between self-report and behaviors but overall alignment
- **Moderately Consistent**: Notable discrepancies in some areas requiring further exploration
- **Significant Concerns**: Major inconsistencies or concerning patterns requiring clarification

- Areas of exceptional capability (potential mentor areas)
- Areas requiring targeted development (training focus)
- Any fundamental concerns that might affect hiring decision

### Final Recommendation

Based on comprehensive analysis:

- **Highly Recommended**: Exceptional candidate across most dimensions
- **Recommended**: Strong candidate with specific development areas identified
- **Conditional Recommendation**: Candidate shows promise but has significant development needs
- **Not Recommended**: Candidate shows fundamental gaps or concerns in critical areas

This comprehensive scoring system provides both quantitative benchmarks and qualitative insights to identify the right candidates while creating a targeted development plan for those selected.
