# UX Improvements for Assessment Application

Based on a UX review of the assessment interface, the following improvements are needed:

## 1. Redundant Progress Indicators
- Replace dual indicators with one consistent tracker
- Use a single progress system showing "Part 1 of 6 (Question 1/10)" 
- Implement a single, more prominent progress bar

## 2. Unclear Relationship Between Progress Indicators
- Create visual hierarchy between assessment and section progress
- Use a primary progress bar for overall assessment
- Add a secondary, indented progress indicator for the current section

## 3. Answer Options Affordances
- Add radio button controls or checkboxes before each option
- Implement hover states, borders, and subtle shadows
- Make clickable areas clearly identifiable

## 6. Redundant Titles
- Remove duplicate "Assessment" heading
- Use "Business Valuation Assessment" as the primary heading
- Maintain consistent labeling throughout the interface

## 8. Insufficient Visual Hierarchy
- Increase question font size and weight
- Add more spacing between question and answer section
- Use background colors or borders to separate questions from answers

## 9. Low Color Contrast
- Use stronger color contrasts for progress bars
- Implement darker blues/greens for better visibility
- Ensure all elements meet WCAG AA contrast standards (4.5:1)

## 11. Limited Whitespace Between Answer Options
- Increase padding between options to at least 16-20px
- Add subtle dividers between options
- Improve vertical spacing for better readability

## 12. Unclear Clickable Boundaries
- Add visible borders around each answer option
- Implement hover effects that highlight the entire answer area
- Use visual cues to indicate interactive elements

## Implementation Plan
1. Update progress indicator components
2. Refine question and answer styling
3. Improve color scheme and contrast
4. Enhance clickable areas and interaction feedback
